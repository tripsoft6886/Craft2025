    <h2>PRIVACY AND DATA POLICY</h2>
    
    <p>BUSSID STUDIO and other applications ("BUSSID STUDIO", "us", "our" or "we") are highly serious in protecting the privacy rights of our users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information including personal information, that you provide or we collect, we believe that your privacy is really important to us or any our game provided on a mobile platform (collectively, the "Service"). Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited to information collected or received by our studio through your use of the Service.</p>

    <p>We are not responsible for the actions of third party people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Any link to those sites or placements by those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.</p>

    <h3>How we protect your information</h3>
    <p>We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from accidental loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, please note that although we take reasonable measures to protect your information, no app, website, Internet transmission, computer system or wireless connection is completely secure.</p>

    <h3>Information we Collect</h3>
    
    <h4>1. Personal Information</h4>
    <p>The information which identifies you personally and/or can be used to contact you online or offline, such as your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photograph, precise geo-location information, and some of apps you may require to share your username.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Non-Personal Information</h4>
    <p>The information which does not identifies you and can not be used to contact you personally. It includes your date of birth, age, ZIP code, your city, gender as well as the information about your mobile device such as unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. It also includes usage data which identifies the browser you use, identity of other apps on device, game process, play time, score and achievements, and URLs you visited and/or apps you used before after using our Apps.</p>
    
    <p>We will not collect any Personal Information from you simply by virtue of your visiting our product; we only collect it if you choose to submit it to us. We do, however, collect Non-Personal Information such as device IDs, IP addresses and other persistent identifiers, as well as Usage Data, whenever you use our Website/Apps. Such Non-Personal Information is not combined with Personal Information unless you choose to submit Personal Information to us.</p>

    <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a small text file that we transfer to your device, to identify a user's device and to remember things about your visit, such as your preferences or a username and password. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of our product, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use.</p>
    
    <p>You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service. We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your device so the content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked.</p>
